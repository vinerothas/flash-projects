# flash-projects

My old projects written in Adobe Flash using AC3.
I no longer own Adobe Flash so the projects are presented in their old wonky state.

Platformer
A simple test for 2D side view movement (WASD) with collisions.
Run Platformer\bin\index.html and enable flash player.

Avoider
Randomly generated obstacles with erratic path. Mouse movement
Run Avoider\bin\index.html and enable flash player.

Strategy
A battle simulator. Some implemented world map functions are blocked
by the battle screen. Directory 'dokumenty' contains multiple design ideas
written in polish.
Run Strategy\Strategy.html and enable flash player.

Some other notable projects that I can no longer find/run include a random
generation of a top-down dungeon/maze and a zombie defense game with a stationary turret
and animated enemies.
