# flash-projects

My old projects written in Adobe Flash using AC3.
I no longer own Adobe Flash so the projects are presented in their old wonky state.  

## Crawler
Navigate 10 randomly generated mazes as quickly as possible. The movement is very quick, so it's best to slide into turns by holding two buttons (forward and turn) at the same times. WASD or arrow keys to move.
Run Dungeon Crawler\crawler.swf using a shockwave flash player (I recommend http://www.swffileplayer.com/).

## Platformer
A simple test for 2D side view movement (WASD) with collisions.
Run Platformer\bin\index.html and enable flash player.

## Avoider
Randomly generated obstacles with erratic path, mouse movement.
Run Avoider\bin\index.html and enable flash player.

## Strategy
A battle simulator. Some implemented world map functions are blocked
by the battle screen. Directory 'dokumenty' contains multiple design ideas
written in polish.
Run Strategy\Strategy.html and enable flash player.
